      <div class="panel1"><p class="editable">That is exactly what a well-designed business insurance portfolio should do. Your job is to handle the expected and reasonably foreseen trade risks which can put you out of business. Your insurance broker and company are there to handle the unexpected and unforeseen risks. They do this by analysing your business operation, then recomending and advising you whether and how to reduce or insure these risks. It is a "partnership" relationship designed to protect your business.</p></div>

        <p class="editable">Once the replacement cost of your residence is determined (usually at the original inception date of your policy) your insurance company updates the replacement value each year based on a building cost inflation factor. At one time it was not uncommon to see the market value of a home far exceed the cost to rebuild the home. These days it is not always so and in many cases the cost to build a home is more than the cost to buy it (including the land). While real estate values are relatively low, the cost of building materials and labour is not.</p>
