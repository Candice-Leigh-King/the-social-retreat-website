  <p><strong>We're sure you can relate to the following scenario. </strong> <br>You arrive at a venue to capture an image that you have thought out in your head, BUT… you just can't seem to capture the amazing skyline and you produce a photo with a blown out/white sky. Or you just can't quite get the colours of the beautiful sky and your image does not give the reality justice.</p><p>
  Another scenario: You have this amazing shot ready, your framing is great the lighting is awesome, BUT… there is a huge powerline across the sky or a ugly fence in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>
  All of us have had those exact scenarios and we have a solution for you. These two apps are great for fixing your sky and removing unwanted lines and objects. Both apps are free, one you can purchase for more features if you want, but for most features it is free.</p>

  <p><strong>LightLeap by lighttricks is an amazing app! </strong> <br> It can convert a bland sky that doesn't do a photo justice and transform the sky to recreate what you actually saw. Often skies can be tricky, and getting the exact magical colours does not always workout. This is where LightLeap comes in, you can choose from an array of different skies, sunsets, nights skies to recreate this magical moment.</p><p>
Make sure when you change the sky that you remember to adjust around the feathering, opacity, horizon and ambience to make it look perfect.</p> <p>
Spend some time getting to know this app and it will become an important tool in your editing arsenal.<p>
