This pre-coursework can be done at your own pace and you can re-watch videos that you need repetition on. To complete the online work, it should take you around 6 - 10 hours. It all depends on how much time you spend on the activities, build your brand and practicing the taught skills. You'll have lifetime access to this course material so you can come back to it any time! </p><p> Although we're going to have tons of fun together over the next few weeks leading up to the retreat and, of course at the retreat, we've got some work to do.
