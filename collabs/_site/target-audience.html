  <p><strong>You cannot be afraid of niching.</strong> To often, we see students trying to target EVERYONE and it gets messy. Although you have many interestes and values that you want to share, it can be very cluttering trying to do target every single niche effectively all.</p>
<p><i>"When yoy speak to everyone, you really speak to no one."</i> </p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to find your target audience also known as yoh communitaaaaay is thinking about your brand as a person.<br>
Imagine you brand was a person (this is easy, because you are your brand), what sort of person would this person be? What type of friends does this person have? What sort of relationships does he/she have? Who does this person associate with?</p>
<p>For example, if Candy and the King were a human, amongst her friends, she is known as “not so serious”, but more fun and bubbly. She's down-to-earth, friendly and always willing to give advice, have meaningful conversation and connect deeply with people.</p>
<p>The more you distinguish about your brand as a person, the better. This doesn't only define your brand's voice, but it helps you to understand the type of people you'd like in your tribe, the kind of community you'd like to connect with with online and offline. This will also help you identify the person you'd one day like to have on your team or even the partnerships, clients and followers you'd like to have in the future.</p>
<p>To find these people online... There are many ways to do so. Our top three recommended ways to find your community is first to find an influencer who is also part of your niche; someone you resonate with. Go through their profile and comments. See who is following them and who they are following and start engaging with these people. <br>
The second way you can find your tribe is through relevant hashtags that you use. <strong>You want to connect with people on the same level.</strong> This means befriend people with the same amount of followers as you, same style, etc.<br>
The last way is through Facebook groups. </p>
<p>Remember, as a content creator you will have your <strong>primary target audience</strong> who are the people in your tribe, and you'll have a <strong>secondary target audience</strong> which are the brands and companies you want to work with.</p> <p>Your goal is to build genuine relationships with both! </p>
<p>To find your secondary target audience: <br>1. look at influencers in your niche who are already working with brands.<br>
2. Use IG as a search engine.<br>
3. Find, follow and pitche to brands that you already use.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p><strong>1. On your table/laptop or using a paper and pen, write down what kind of person would your brand be? </strong><br>What type of friends does this person have? What sort of relationships does he/she have? Who does this person associate with?</p>
<p><strong>2.Ask yourself other questions like: where does he/she spend their money and time? What sort of job does this person have? What are his/her hobbies? What sort of personality does he/she have?</strong><br>How about this person's skills and responsibilities? What country does this person come from and wha languages can she/he speak? Are they expats? Locals? Internationals?</p>
<p><strong>3. Find 2 to 3 people just like this on IG and connect with them.</strong></p>
