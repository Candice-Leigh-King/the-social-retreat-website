  <p><strong>Personal branding isn't actually branding your personal life.</strong> It's branding the aspect of your life that you forsee adding value, meaning or entertainment to a certain community. The difficulity lies in deciding what to then to brand.</p>
<p>There is a step-by-step process that can help you do just that. </p>
<p><strong>Firstly, you want to find your essence.</strong></p>
<p>Your essence is a central theme of your brand. It's a single thought that wraps it all up. A good essence can be minimised into one word. This isn't necessarily a word that you'd show off to the world. This is simply for you to come back to and help you remember where you come from.</p>
<p>An example of an essence is "community". This is the essence for Candy and the King, because we do wraps around community. Other examples of an essence are, "joy", "love", "education".</p> <p><i> Finding your essence “can be magic in terms of internal communication, inspiration to employees and partners...” - David Aaker (He's like a branding guru for corporates.)</i></p>
<p><strong>Next, discover your purpose.</strong> Your purpose is the pursuit of your dreams, and the expression of your why. This is possibly the most challenging thing for anyone to do, but really discovering your "why" gives EVERYTHING you do meaning. It will get you up in the morning when you really don't want to and it'll give you the joy to push through all the walls that are bound to come.</p><p>Your purpose has to be much more than a salary, because just like with any job, money isn't enough. Eventually, you'll want to chase something else. Besides, you are so much more than that! And so are the dreams and desires of your heart. So, we need to find the things that freak you out with absolute excitement! </p>
<p><strong>Lastly, we want to solidify your values.</strong> You probably already have a brief idea of your values already.</p><p>It's really important to define your brand values, because they will keep you rooted.</p> <p>Knowing your values also helps you identify brands you want to work or partner with and the kind of community you want to be a part of.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p><strong>1. Go to the place that you feel is best for you to relax. Take time to uncover all your past dreams that you had when you were a child.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. With a paper and pen or a on your tablet/laptop, write down some of these dreams.</strong></p>
<p> Question your dream. Why did you want to become that or do it?</p>
<p><strong>3. Write down your reason for your dream. </strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Try sum up the reason into one word.</strong></p>
<p> If that's too difficult, write a few words that could be the reason behind your dream. It could be something like:<br>significance<br>helping<br>caring<br>protection<br>entertainment
</p><p> Which one of the words that you wrote is most valuable?</p>
<p>Look for synonyms of that word. You might find something that is more suitable or that best describes the reason behind your dreams. </p>
<p><strong>5. Translate this into the context of branding</strong></p>
<p>Our goal here is to find that central theme to your brand.</p>
