  <h4>Finding Brands to Pitch To!</h4>
  <p>Before you get to this step it's SO important to work on your profile and get it to a place that showcases the value you can offer to brands with both your content and the connection you have with your audience. You will have a much higher success rate pitching to brands that actually want to work with you, so let's go over how to narrow down brands that fit your niche!</p>
  <h4>Narrow Down Your Requirements</h4>
<p><strong>1. What Does Your Audience Need To Make Their Life Easier/Better?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to finding brands to work with, thinking about what your audience wants or needs is a great way to come up with a list of brands to pitch to. You always want to make sure your partnerships are not only mutually beneficial to the brand and yourself, to your audience as well!
</p>
<p>Brainstorm 10 products your ideal follower needs in their life. If you're a travel niche for example this could be hiking clothes, backpack, snacks for a hike/road trip, or whatever else you can think of. If you have a sub niche like sustainable travel use those categories as well! Think vegan or eco friendly products to take on your travels like sustainable toothpaste or organic granola bars.<br>
Remember, it's also okay to think of yourself as your ideal follower! Just make sure the items you want/need are within your niche on Instagram.

</p>
<p><strong>2. Is The Brand on Social Media?</strong></p>
<p>You can even take this question one step further and ask, "Is the brand working with influencers?" You can usually tell when a brand is working with influencers because they share photos of the influencers they work with! If you pitch to a brand that is already familiar with the benefit of working with influencers then you might have an easier time getting a "yes!" But don't let this limit you! If there is a brand you really want to work with or think your audience would really resonate with, don't be afraid to approach that brand even if their profile doesn't look like they work with influencers, because you can't get what you don't ask for!
</p>
<p><strong>3. Does Your Profile Align With The Brand's Demographics?</strong></p>

<p class="col-12"><strong>4. Create Your Ideal Brand List</strong></p>
<p>Once you have a list of products you are confident your audience would love then it's time to find the brands that actually sell these products! We're going to go over a few different methods to find them now!
</p>
<p><strong>1. Use Instagram As A Search Engine</strong></p>
<p>Our favorite way of finding brands to work with is by using Instagram as a search engine! That way you already KNOW the brand is using social media marketing. Let's go over the steps on how to do this properly!
<ul>
  <li><strong>Search hashtags the Brand would use.</strong> Brands use hashtags just the same as influencers do to get people to search and find their products, so search for the hashtags that relate to the products you're trying to find! For some of the examples we gave earlier it could be #organicgranolabars or #sustainabletoothpaste... basically whatever the product is!
  </li>
  <li><strong>Find the Brands that make these products.</strong> Scrolling down the hashtag page you can usually tell a brand page by the photos they use. It also helps if the brand is made in the region where the majority of your followers are. If you are from Australia and the majority of your followers are Aussies then a company that doesn't ship to Australia might not be willing to work with you! The closer you are to the brand's ideal client, the better!
  </li>
  <li><strong>Follow the Brand and screen shot for later.</strong> You will need to do this with every method you use. It is SO incredibly important you establish a relationship with a brand before you pitch, so follow them, like a few of their photos, and screenshot their account page for later so you have easy access to their details on pitch day!
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Take Note Of Brands Other Influencers Work With!</strong></p>
<p>When you come across a promotion post from another influencer you follow (assuming they are in your same niche) then take note of the brand they are working with! Go to their profile, follow them, and screen shot for later! This method works so well because the brand is already working with influencers.
</p>

<p><strong>3. Use Influencer Apps Or Facebook Groups To Find Brands!</strong></p>
<p>There are tons of influencer apps that are made to connect creators and brands! Some to try out are Aspire IQ, Heartbeat, Tribe, and Collabstr. They make finding brands super simple, however I've found that most of the time these apps way under pay you (Collabstr you set your rates). It's great if you're first starting out and testing your influence, but after establishing yourself you will have much better luck and more income coming in when you reach out to brands yourself. There are also influencer Facebook groups that allow brands to post about potential collaborations! From what we've seen they are mostly fashion or beauty based brands, but you never know what sort of opportunities could arise!
</p>

<p><strong>4.  Choose The Brands You Already Love!</strong></p>
<p>Don't be afraid to approach the brands you already know and love no matter how big or small the brand may be. There's that saying, "you can't get what you don't ask for!"<br>

P.S. If you "naturally" share photos or stories of the brand you already love, they might be more willing to work with you or approach you to work together! Make sure you only tag them in relevant photos where you can clearly see the product or you're talking about it on your stories. You don't want to come off as spammy!
