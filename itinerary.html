    <h3 class="centered"> A Once in a Lifetime Experience</h3>
    <p class="fadein">Kenya is known as the heartbeat of Africa for a reason. It's abundance of wildlife that graze on the affluent grasslands of the country's many national parks, makes for a safari wonderland to anyone interested to see animals such as the big 5 with the backdrop of Africa's tallest peak. The vastness of Kenya's beauty does not end at the big 5 - it also has some of the best untouched white sand beaches with crystal clear water and thriving coral reefs. Kenya is truly a melting pot of culture with diverse cuisine and wildlife to see every corner you turn.</p>

      <h3> Watamu Marine National Park and Reserve </h3>
      <p> UNESCO protected Malindi-Watamu Biosphere Reserve is known for it's rock platforms, cliffs, coral gardens, seagrass and the widest range of mangrove animal species in eastern Africa. This unesco protected area is minutes away from our villa, so we will be spending time exploring the preserved beaches and swimming around colourful coral gardens.

      <h3> Tsavo East National Park</h3>
      <p> We will be staying overnight at one of Kenya's oldest and largest parks. Seeing African animals in their natural habitat is on everyone's bucket list, and if not it should be. We will spend two days driving through the African savannah on the lookout for the infamous big 5, each day will bring new perspectives and new experiences. You will spend one night in an actual safari park and sleep with the beautiful sounds of the African night.
