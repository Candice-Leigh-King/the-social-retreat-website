       <h4 class="editable"> Is this retreat for me? </h4>
      <div class="panel1"><p class="editable">That is exactly what a well-designed business insurance portfolio should do. Your job is to handle the expected and reasonably foreseen trade risks which can put you out of business. Your insurance broker and company are there to handle the unexpected and unforeseen risks. They do this by analysing your business operation, then recomending and advising you whether and how to reduce or insure these risks. It is a "partnership" relationship designed to protect your business.</p></div>

        <h4 class="editable"> What is a social media retreat/bootcamp?</h4>
      <div class="panel2">
        <p class="editable">That’s like asking, "How long is a piece of string?" The best thing to do would be to find an experienced and reputable insurance broker who, after analysing your requirements and risk profile, will develop an insurance portfolio to suite your unique needs.</p>

        <h4 class="editable"> How does it cost?</h4>
      <div class="panel3">
        <p class="editable">Yes, your company could be liable for accidents that might happen because the car was being used for YOUR BUSINESS even though you don’t own it. You need to make sure that your business insurance includes "Contingent Liability" (or "Employer's Non-Owned Motor Liability Insurance") to protect the business from liability for vehicles that it uses but does NOT own. Even if you own other vehicles, and  have them insured, make sure the Contingent Liability extension has been added.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
         <h4 class="editable">Is a payment plan available?</h4>
      <div class="panel4">
        <p class="editable">Once the replacement cost of your residence is determined (usually at the original inception date of your policy) your insurance company updates the replacement value each year based on a building cost inflation factor. At one time it was not uncommon to see the market value of a home far exceed the cost to rebuild the home. These days it is not always so and in many cases the cost to build a home is more than the cost to buy it (including the land). While real estate values are relatively low, the cost of building materials and labour is not.</p>
