  <div class="col-12">
    <h5>RETREAT TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h5>
    <p>These are the Terms and Conditions that will apply to your retreat booking. Please read them carefully as you will be bound by them.
These Terms shall constitute the entire agreement between The Social Media Retreat Sole Proprietorship (also referred to as Social Media Retreat) and the Client relating to the subject matter herein, and shall constitute a binding agreement. There is no verbal or written; representation, warranty, prior agreement, or description of services, other than as expressed herein.
The contract and booking is made with, and services will be provided by, The Social Media Retreat Sole Proprietorship. By booking a trip, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions that govern the relationship, the cancellation policy and limitations of liability. These Terms and Conditions affect your rights and designate the governing law and forum for the resolution of any and all disputes.
</p>
    <h5>BOOKING RETREATS + THE CONTRACT</h5>
    <p>All persons wishing to make a booking have carefully read and understand the Terms and Conditions that follow. By making a booking with Social Media Retreat, you accept on behalf of yourself and all those named on the booking, including minor(s) and/or person(s) under a disability to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. A booking is accepted and becomes definite only from the date when Social Media Retreat sends a confirmation email. It is at this point that a contract between Social Media Retreat and the Client comes into existence. Before your booking is confirmed and a contract comes into force, Social Media Retreat reserves the right to increase or decrease trip prices. Social Media Retreat reserves the right to decline any booking at their discretion. The person or persons named on the booking are hereafter referred to as the "Client". All bookings are made with Social Media Retreat, which sells the retreat described in this website.<br>A Social Media Retreat Representative will contact you regarding your completed registration to confirm your participation in your selected trip. Confirmation of your participation does not necessarily mean that your trip is confirmed to run. Social Media Retreat encourages you to refrain from purchasing non-refundable travel until you have all the information and are certain you are ready to purchase.
</p>
    <h5>DEPOSITS + CANCELLATIONS</h5>
    <p>You may book a retreat with a deposit (down payment) until 30 days prior to the retreat start date, after which full payment is required to secure your spot. <br>
The remaining balance of your retreat payment is due 30 days before the retreat begins. We notify you of the balance due date after your deposit has been processed. We understand that unexpected events can arise that can affect your plans. We recommend all our retreat guests purchase travel insurance to protect their purchase. Booking early ensures you a spot in a retreat, many of which sell out far in advance.
</p>
<p><b>Deposits are non-refundable.</b></p>
<p>If you cancel more than 60+ days before the retreat start date, you may request a 100% remaining balance refund, but forfeit your deposit.<br>
If you cancel 30-59 days before retreat start date, you may request a 50% remaining balance refund, but forfeit your deposit.<br>
If you cancel 0-29 days before retreat start date, you may not request a refund of any kind.
</p>
<p><b>Pricing + Fees</b></p>
<p>All retreat prices are quoted and payable in USD.<br>
Social Media Retreat is not responsible for any fees incurred due to currency exchange or fees charged by your credit card/bank for processing funds in another currency.
</p>
    <h5>MEDICAL CONDITIONS + SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</h5>
    <p>The Client must notify Social Media Retreat in writing during the process of booking of any medical conditions, pregnancy, disability or any other mental and or physical condition which may affect fitness to travel and/or any medical condition. Failure to notify Social Media Retreat of any such condition that results in cancellation will have deposit forfeited by the Client. Some trips may be unsuitable for Clients due to age, mobility, disability, pregnancy or physical or mental conditions. It is the Client's responsibility to check prior to booking. Social Media Retreat may refuse to accept pregnant women over 24 weeks or Clients with certain conditions. Social Media Retreat is not required to provide any special facilities unless it has agreed to do so in writing. Social Media Retreat will do its best to meet Clients special requests including dietary, but such requests do not form part of the Contract and therefore Social Media Retreat is not liable for not providing these requests. Medical facilities vary from place to place and Social Media Retreat makes no representations and gives no warranties in relation to the standard of such treatment.
</p>
    <h5>ACCEPTANCE OF BOOKING + FINAL PAYMENTS</h5>
    <p><b>Acceptance of Booking</b></p>
    <p>
Social Media Retreat will confirm acceptance of the Client's booking via email. Please ensure Social Media Retreat is on your contact list so our emails don't go to your junk folder!
</p>
<p><b>Final Payment</b></p>
<p>For all retreats, the payment of the final balance payment is due 30 days prior to the retreat start date, if you choose a payment plan option.</p>
<p><b>Once You've Paid Your Full Retreat Payment</b></p>
<p>Full retreat payments can only be refunded if you notify us 60 days or more before the retreat start date. For this reason, we recommend you purchase travel insurance to fully reimburse you for the pre-paid, non-refundable portions of your booking if you experience a covered loss due to an unforeseen event such as illness or inclement weather.<br>
Social Media Retreat is not responsible for finding someone to take your place.<br>
If the final balance is not received by the due date, then your booking cannot be guaranteed and Social Media Retreat reserves the right to cancel your booking and forfeit your deposit and remaining balance.
</p>
    <h5>CANCELLATION OF A RETREAT HELD BY The Social Media Retreat</h5>
    <p>
Social Media Retreat reserves the right to cancel any trip for any reason, but will not cancel a retreat less than 90 days before the retreat start date except for Force Majeure, unusual or unforeseen circumstances outside the Social Media Retreat control. When a retreat is canceled by Social Media Retreat before the agreed start date for any reason other than the fault of the Client, the Client can either:
Transfer their deposit to another retreat taking place within the next 12 months, or:
Receive a full refund of monies paid under the contract as soon as possible.<br>
Social Media Retreat is not responsible for any incidental expenses or consequential losses that the Client may have incurred as a result of the booking such as visas, vaccinations, non-refundable flights or rail, non-refundable car parking or other fees, loss of earnings, or loss of enjoyment, etc. If the Client is offered a refund, but requests an alternate tour of a higher value than that originally booked, then the Client must pay the difference in price. Where after departure a significant element of the trip contracted for cannot be provided, Social Media Retreat will make suitable alternative arrangements for the continuation of the trip. If it is not possible to provide a suitable alternative or the Client reasonably rejects any suitable alternatives, Social Media Retreat will not be held responsible to provide the Client a refund of unused retreat portions. Where a significant alteration or cancellation occurs which is due to Force Majeure or other circumstances beyond the Social Media Retreat's control, Social Media Retreat will not be held responsible to provide the Client a refund of unused retreat portions.
</p>
    <h5>AIRFARE</h5>
    <p>All Social Media Retreat retreats do not include national or international airfare. Social Media Retreat strongly recommends you wait until the trip is confirmed to run before booking airfare or making any non-refundable travel arrangements.</p>
    <h5>MEALS</h5>
    <p>All Social Media Retreat retreats include breakfast, lunch and dinner at the villa. It is the sole responsibility of the Client to provide their own drinks and snacks throughout the retreat. Social Media Retreat will not be held liable for any contamination of food, allergies, or other unforeseen circumstances that may arise during the retreat in regards to meals, food, drinks, or snacks even if such items are provided by Social Media Retreat at any stage. </p>
    <h5>TRAVEL + HEALTH INSURANCE</h5>
    <p>Social Media Retreat requires Clients obtain travel medical insurance with a minimum medical coverage of $100,000 while traveling with Social Media Retreat. This insurance must cover personal injury and emergency medical expenses.<br>
It is strongly recommended the coverage be extended to include cancellation, curtailment, and all other expenses that might arise as a result of loss, damage, injury, delay or inconvenience occurring to the Client during travel. Social Media Retreat shall have no liability for loss, theft of or damage to baggage or personal effects. Personal belongings lost or stolen while unattended by the client in public lounges or other public areas, whether on board a train, bus, or other mode of transportation, publicly owned or operated by Social Media Retreat or elsewhere, are not reimbursable. Losses due to ordinary wear and tear, and other acts of God are not reimbursable. Social Media Retreat cannot accept responsibility for and in no event shall be liable for loss or damage of valuables or other articles left in or on facilities used by Social Media Retreat such as hotels, huts, expedition vehicles, boats or any other mode of transportation.<br>
The Client acknowledges that the cost of Social Media Retreat retreats do not include insurance and that the Client has been advised to obtain separate coverage at an additional cost. When obtaining travel insurance the Client must ensure the insurer is aware of the type of travel to be undertaken.
</p>
    <h5>EVACUATION PROCEDURES AND COSTS</h5>
    <p>We reserve the right to prohibit any traveler from continuing on a trip with no right of refund if, in our opinion, that traveler's actions pose a threat to the safety of others, to the wildlife, themselves, or if the traveler's actions and/or behaviors are harming the enjoyment of the trip for others.<br>
Evacuations costs are to be covered by the person being evacuated if injury occurs.
</p>
    <h5>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS</h5>
    <p>Valid Passport: The Client must be in possession of a valid passport required for entry, departure and travel to retreat destinations outside the U.S. (passport must be valid 6 months past the return date), all visas, permits and certificates including vaccination certificates (if required), insurance policies, etc. are required for the whole of the journey. The Client accepts full responsibility for obtaining all such documents, visas and permits prior to the start of the retreat and is solely responsible for any adverse consequences resulting from missing or defective documentation. Any information or advice given by Social Media Retreat regarding visas, vaccinations, climate, clothing, baggage, special equipment, etc. is purely advisory, provided as a courtesy to the Client and Social Media Retreat is not responsible for any errors or omissions as to the information provided by third parties such as the appropriate governmental authorities.<br>
Retreat Details: To expedite the obtaining of travel documents and flight bookings please note that all international trip-related documents such as Retreat Planning Guides will be sent via email once the trip is confirmed to run. Social Media Retreat will aim to confirm trips within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
    <h5>CLAIMS + COMPLAINTS</h5>
    <p>If a Client has a complaint against Social Media Retreat, the Client must first inform the Retreat Host or guide at the earliest opportunity to allow the grievance to be rectified. Failure to indicate dissatisfaction whilst on tour will result in the Client's ability to claim compensation from Social Media Retreat being extinguished. Social Media Retreat reserves the right to dictate compensation amount to the Client.
If satisfaction is still not reached through these means on retreat then any further complaint must be put in writing to Social Media Retreat within 30 days of the end of the trip. </p>

    <h5>CLIENT RESPONSIBILITY</h5>
    <p>The Client acknowledges he or she will be visiting places where the political, cultural and geographical attributes present certain risks, and physical challenges greater than those present in her daily life. By booking a retreat with Social Media Retreat, the Client acknowledges they have considered the potential risks, dangers and challenges, and expressly assumes the risks attendant to such travel conditions. The Client is solely responsible for acquainting themselves with different geographical areas, weather conditions, physical challenges, and laws in effect along the itinerary, and is encouraged to make contact with their family or friends regarding the trip destination.</p>

These may limit or exclude the liability of the supplier. The liability of Social Media Retreat will not exceed that of any supplier. Local laws and regulations of the relevant country will be relevant in assessing the performance of the services of any supplier. Neither Social Media Retreat nor any carrier is liable for independent contractors.</p>

    <h5>SAFETY + TRIP ENJOYMENT</h5>
    <p>We take your safety and well-being very seriously, which is why we partner with licensed companies and other trained professionals for our retreats. However, you are ultimately responsible for your safety, which is why we ask all retreat participants to sign a liability waiver before the start date. To avoid possibly dangerous situations, it is extremely important that you obey any rules and regulations imposed by the Social Media Retreat Retreat Hosts and instructions given by them.<br>
Social Media Retreat reserves the right to prohibit any Client from continuing on a trip with no right of refund if, in our opinion, that Client's actions pose a threat to the safety of them, others, or to the wildlife, or if that Client's actions or behaviors are seriously jeopardizing the enjoyment of the trip for others. The decision of the Social Media Retreat Retreat Host or representative will at all times be final on all matters likely to affect the safety and well-being of the trip. All Clients must, at all times, strictly comply with the laws, and regulations of all cities and or states visited, and Social Media Retreat will not accept responsibility or liability for any Client who contravenes any laws or other regulations of any place visited.

    <h5>HEALTH + FITNESS</h5>
    <p>Most trips should not be overly strenuous for people who are healthy and reasonably fit. All travelers are expected to carry their own bags, maneuver stairs, and be able to walk outside on outdoor pathways. If you (or anyone on whose behalf you are booking) are affected by any condition, medical or otherwise, that might affect your or other people's enjoyment of the trip, you must advise us of this at the time of booking. If your health or fitness changes between the time of booking and the trip departure date, you must notify the Social Media Retreat of these changes before the trip starts.

No responsibility is accepted for losses, expenses due to delays, changes of flights or other services, because of strikes, accidents, sickness, damage, negligence, weather, war, changes in schedules or other similar causes. Social Media Retreat and its partners do not assume responsibility for accidents or deaths that can be traced to the participants' negligence, acts of third parties or exterior circumstances such as weather, natural occurrences, ware or other similar causes.</p>

    <h5>DATA PROTECTION</h5>
    <p>To ensure that the retreat runs smoothly, Social Media Retreat needs to use personal information (such as name, address, special needs, health conditions, dietary requirements etc.) provided by Clients to Social Media Retreat, and also pass on such information to other guides or suppliers involved in the operation of the trip. Social Media Retreat will apply appropriate security measures to protect such personal data and will only pass on data that is applicable to guides or suppliers responsible for the retreat. By completing the Social Media Retreat Retreat Booking Form, Clients consent to this information being transferred as required.
</p>

    <h5>LIABILITY</h5>
